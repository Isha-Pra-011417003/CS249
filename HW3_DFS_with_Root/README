TO BEGIN EXECUTION

-To start the execution, run the Main.java file.

FLOW OF EXECUTION
-----------------------------------------------------
-The Main class constructor calls the init() method which is used to initialize the Processors.
-Currently, only 5 processors are initialized. Following that, we add the list of neighbors of all the 
nodes as a value for the HashMap called 'graph' where the key is the node itself.  
-Post that, we call sendInitialMsg() to begin the execution of the actual algorithm by sending an initial
message M to one of the nodes in the graph.
-When the entire algorithm has run its course, we call the displaySpanningTree() method to display the 
spanning tree constructed as a result of our DFS algorithm
