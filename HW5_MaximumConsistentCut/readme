FLOW OF EXECUTION
___________________________________________________________________________

Main.java

- Here we create an object of the Algorithm class to initiate the Execution plan of the processors.
- We take the input for the cut from the user and call the printMaxCut() method in the Algorithm class.

Algorithm.java

- We define the execution plan for each processor
- We have defined the printMaxCut() method, which in turn, calls the calculateMaxCut() method in the Processor class

Processor.java

- addToStoreArray(): This method is called after each event to add the vector clock to the storeArray for that processor.
- printStoreArray(): This method prints the final storeArray for that processor,
- calculateVectorClocks(): This method performs the appropriate operation according to the Message.type received in the message buffer of that processor.
- calculateMaxCut(): This method calculates the maximum cut for the input cut provided.

VectorClock.java

- We overloaded the VectorClock constructor to take an integer array as an input.
- compareTo(): In this method, we compare the 2 vector clocks and return appropriate values based on the comparison.
