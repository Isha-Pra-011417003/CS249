CHANDY LAMPORT ALGORITHM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chandyâ€“Lamport algorithm is a snapshot algorithm that is used in distributed systems for recording a consistent global state of an asynchronous system. It was developed by and named after Leslie Lamport and K. Mani Chandy.

How to run the code:

- Run the main.java as a java application.

Code structure:

- Main.java: Here, we create 3 threads to start the execution plan for each processor and initiate the snapshot for processor 1.

- Processor.java: This class performs all the operations related to a processor. It has methods to :
		> check if a marker message received is the first marker
		> to make the incoming channel from which marker was received as empty
		> to initiate snapshot by starting recording on the incoming channels by spawning new threads
		> a dummy method to record the current state of a processor
		> a sendMessageTo function which saves the message in the particular channel and triggers to call the update method.
		> the update method is where the chandy-lamport algorithm is defined.
		
- Buffer.java: A class which has the incoming messages for each channel.

- Message.java: Gives the message type and from which processor it was sent or received.

- Algorithm.java: A class where execution plan for each processor is defined.
